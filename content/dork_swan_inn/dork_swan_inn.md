# Inn-troductions
In the heart of the bustling city of **DEEPQUESTWICH**, the streets echoed with the cacophony of merchants haggling and footsteps of travelers from distant lands.  "The Dork Swan Inn" was an establishment that embodied the essence of adventure and opportunity, with a charismatic innkeeper at the helm.
:
Behind the bar, the weathered bartender (**RICKARD REDD**) wipes a glass with a cloth as tattered as the stories shared at his counter. Patrons lean in close, voices lowered as they exchanged hushed words, their eyes darting about in search of prying ears. In that smoky inn, danger lingered in the corners, a silent partner in the raucous revelry that dared to defy the passage of time. It was a place where fortunes were made, lost, and gambled once more, and where a careless whisper could change the course of one's fate forever.

# The Dork Swan Inn
:
The inn itself is a marvel. Walls covered in tattered maps, trophies of exotic creatures, mementos and hard won treasures from past adventures. The atmosphere is cozy, warm, and welcoming. Roaring hearths, heavy wooden beams, and the scent of roasted meats wafting from the kitchen.
:
There was, as well, a very popular, yet somewhat uncommon, feature: the message board just outside the entrance. **RICKARD** maintained this job board with great care. Over the years, it became a well known posting site for odd and unusual requests. The type of jobs best filled by adventurers The board was built from weathered oak and mahogany and adorned with brass fittings. Tacked onto the board are parchment notices, each marked with a different quest or opportunity for adventurers, ranging from simple errands to daring expeditions. A worn note sat at the top, stating,
:
{{note,text-align:center
“**SEE RR FOR ARRANGEMENTS**”
}}
:
As you step through the worn, creaking door of the smoky inn, you are instantly enveloped in a world of sensory intrigue. The dim, hazy atmosphere casts a soft, amber glow over the bustling crowd. Conversations, both whispered and boisterous, create a tapestry of voices that weave through the room, punctuated by laughter and the clinking of glasses. The air is thick with the aroma of aged tobacco, spilled whiskey, and something indefinable, a hint of danger lurking in the corners.
:
Meet **RICKARD REDD**, the friendly, bearded innkeeper of The Dork Swan. **RICKARD** is a stout and robust dwarf with a shock of silver hair and a perpetual twinkle in his emerald green eyes. His rough hands, scarred from a lifetime of ale-tapping and coin-counting, belied the warmth of his welcoming smile. **RICKARD** had a personality as big as his heart, a trait that endeared him to the adventurers who passed through his inn. But **RICKARD** also had a dark side.

* **Where**: All throughout Deepquetwich; Hideout in woods outside town; In secret basement room of Baron's Mansion
#### Description
The Thieves Guild is a real presence in the city. However, the Mayor, Town Council, or City Guard knows who runs it or where it is located.
:
It turns out that Baron Darklius Ravenwing, Tiefling Baron of Deepquestwich, is the secret head of the Thieve's Guild.
He has been running the guild from his mansion in the southeast of town.
:
A hidden staircase and passage that can be accessed from his study leads to a secret guild meeting room.
From there, a secret tunnel leads to a smuggler's cove just outside town.
The cove is accessible from the docks via a drainage tunnel.
:
This location has been advantageous for the Guild to be able to smuggle goods and contraband via the docks, to the cove, to the baron.
Using the Baron's connections to other Cities and Towns, the Guild has been able to launder stolen goods by selling them to other rich nobles, merchants, and dealers of fine things.
